# Integer_To_Binary

# This program takes a number as input and generates it's binary equivalent.

# I am an aspring Software Engineer currently in college and this is one of my
# school projects. It's simple to most but I am proud of it and want to start using
# Github to document my progression in coding.

#Feel free to comment or send a message if you have any ways I can improve my code! :)
